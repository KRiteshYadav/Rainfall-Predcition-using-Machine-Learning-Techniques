# Rainfall-Predcition-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This repository contains the work done by me and my friend in Predicting the rainfall using Machine Learning. 
The dataset which we have used to test contains rainfall over 12 months from 1901-2015, the dataset is availale at data.gov.in.
We have used ARIMA model for Timeseries forecasting of rainfall.
